# Codecool Online Shop

The goal is to build an Online Shop, an online eCommerce web-application with Java, where users can register, login and logout, browse products, add them into a shopping cart, checkout items and make payments. We implemented a PostgreSql database using JDBC and we used Bootstrap and Thymeleaf for the front-end part of the project.
